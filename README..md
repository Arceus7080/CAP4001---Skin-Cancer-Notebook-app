"Automated Skin Cancer Detection using Deep Learning on Dermoscopic Images"
This GitHub repository outlines our Capstone Project, a deep learning-based system for early skin cancer detection. We'll cover our project's technical considerations and source code that guide our work. Our goal is to develop a tool capable of making timely and accurate malignant diagnoses, using Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs).
